Tailwind Builder

*** NOTE: npm commands overwrite the ./public directory. ***

1. Getting Started

Project's source files are placed in ./src/ directory. 

* ./src/assets - default static files (eg. image placeholders). You should replace them with your own files.

* ./src/tailwind/ - Tailwind config file used to build the theme. Variables used in Theme Customizer are located in tailwind.config.js file.

* ./src/*.pug - All your pages (templates) are stored in separated .pug files.

2. Installation

# Install dependencies
npm install 

# Run dev server with live preview (Browsersync)
npm run watch

# Or make a production build
npm run build

!!! If you want PurgeCSS to delete unnecessary CSS classes (and create a smaller CSS file as a result) set NODE_ENV to production, e.g:

# Make a production build and automatically use PurgeCSS
# to remove CSS classes that aren't used.
NODE_ENV=production npm run build
