# Marketing Site in a box

Marketing site in a box gives you everything you need for a beautiful marketing site or landing page in just a few clicks.
And because it's [powered by Editmode](https://editmode.com), all of the content can be managed, updated and changed by you or anyone on your team - technical or otherwise.
Additionally, you get a real live codebase, running on Tailwind and Next.js, that you can modify and update as you please ðŸ¤—

There are two parts to Marketing Site In A Box - The pre-built theme(s), which you can browse here, and the content, which we've pre-packaged into a clonable Editmode project. We've spent a good deal of time and energy preparing and polishing both to make sure that you you have everything you need to get up and running super quickly.
