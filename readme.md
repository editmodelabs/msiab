# Marketing Site in a box

Congratulations, you've come up with a great product!

Now, it's time to tell the world about it.

There's just one problem. Where do you start? Creating a marketing website takes a **lot** of time and effort.
Time and effort that would be much better spent building your actual product.

Not any more...

Marketing site in a box gives you everything you need to get a beautiful website or landing page, deployed to the internet, in less than 10 minutes.
And because it's [powered by Editmode](https://editmode.com), all of the content can be managed, updated and changed by you or anyone on your team - technical or otherwise.
Additionally, you get a real live codebase, running on Tailwind and Next.js, that you can modify and update as you please ðŸ¤—

### How It Works

1. Clone the Editmode Website Starter project from here.
2. Choose a theme from our Theme Gallery below.
3. Start the process of deploying your chosen theme to Vercel by hitting the deploy button in the theme's readme directory, and add the `NEXT_PUBLIC_EDITMODE_PROJECT_ID` environment variable (the value of which should be the project ID generated for you upon cloning the starter project) during the deployment flow within Vercel.
4. Get a website with all of its content fully managed by Editmode (_coughs_ us) and then show your friends and the world at large.

Whoop!
