### How It Works

1. Clone the Editmode Website Starter project from [here](https://app.editmode.com/projects/prj_Y5HfCBS4rqZg/clone). Take note of your newly created project id.
2. Browse our [themes](https://github.com/editmodelabs/msiab/tree/main/themes) and hit the deploy button on your chosen theme to deploy it straight to Vercel. This will also create a copy of the codebase into your own github account. Set the `NEXT_PUBLIC_PROJECT_ID` variable, as recorded in Step 1.
3. Open your new website and hit `CMD & SHIFT & E` to enable Editmode and update your content inline. Visit the Editmode Content Hub and invite your team to let them make updates too.

That's it, congrats! You now have a beautiful, content managed marketing website ready to expand and deploy as you please. ðŸ¤—

## Working with content

The **Editmode Marketing Site Starter Project** contains all of the content that populates the theme. The content is stored in Editmode (as opposed to inside the files), so that anyone on your team - technical or non-technical, can access and change it at any time. Getting your own copy of the content is as simple as cloning the project in one click from [ðŸ‘‰ here ðŸ‘ˆ](https://app.editmode.com/projects/prj_Y5HfCBS4rqZg/clone). 

Once you've cloned the project, you'll now have access to all of the chunks inside of it. Every chunk has an identifier that you can reference from your theme.

## Render a piece of Editmode content from Next.js

Rendering a piece of content from Editmode within your template is as simple as... 
```jsx
<Chunk identifier="logo_icon" className="w-5 text-primary" />
```

The above snippet will render the chunk with the `logo_icon` identifier, but you can replace it with whatever content you're trying to fetch.


## Rendering a collection
The `<Chunk />` syntax mentioned above is useful when referencing standalone pieces of content like the logo or section headings, but each theme will also contain _repeatable_ content - for example your team members section will have a collection of items which each have the same fields - name, profile image, and description. This content is stored in **_collections_**. We can fetch and loop through every item in an Editmode collection using the `<ChunkCollection />` component, as shown here.

```jsx
 <ChunkCollection identifier="navigation_items" tags={["top_nav"]}  className="hidden absolute top-1/2 left-1/2 transform -translate-y-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 lg:flex lg:mx-auto lg:flex lg:items-center lg:w-auto" itemClass="team_member">
          
  { (getChunk, chunk) => (
    <div className="flex items-center">
      <a className="text-sm text-gray-400 hover:text-gray-500 px-4" href={getChunk(chunk,"Url")}>
        {getChunk(chunk,"Title")}
      </a>
    </div>              
  )}

</ChunkCollection>
```
